Our FIRST robotics teams goal was to design and build a robotic in 6 weeks to compete in a global competion. We had to work togther to prioritize different tasks and design with each other so different systems didn't conflict. I worked heavly on design and integration working between subteams to make sure everyone was on the same page. While I was on the team I designed my own systems including a drive train, grabing mechanism, climbing system, and more.
