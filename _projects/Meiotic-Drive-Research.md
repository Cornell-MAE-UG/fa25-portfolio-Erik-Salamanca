Meiotic drives are genes that violate Mendel's Law of Segregation by impeding the proliferation of the other chromosomes version of that gene. This selfishly promotes their own tranmission by elimation of the competition. The mechanisms can vary, in females the main method is to turn other Oocytes into polar bodies that can not function properly. In males there are two major methods, one involves the gene impeding the process of meiosis two so that half the gamates do not form. The other involves the gamates with the driver killing ones without again resulting in half the typical amount of gamates. 

Our research is about identifying meiotic drivers using drosophila as a model organism. We did this by taking a marker stock with mCherry or GFP and crossing them with wildtype Zambia line drosophila. Again crossing the progeny with another stock we could observe the 3rd generation for the markers to see if those genes were passed on. Based on the presence of our markers, phenotypes, and gender we could identify wether a driver was present. Gender is important as the mechanism are gender specific. If we see a favored gene in both genders we know it is not a driver but the fitness of the gene. Only if we see the driver in one gender can we be confident it is a driver.
