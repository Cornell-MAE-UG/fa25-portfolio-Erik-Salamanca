Our goal was to design a product that would assit skiers with their expirence skiing. We found that many people found it tiring to carry their skies form their cars to the mount, but didn't want to spend lots of money on a expensive new backpack. We set out to design a product that could attach to any backpack and fit any ski size. To do this we created a system that would be buckled around a backpack and clip into the skis existing spot for boots. These connections are very secure as they were alreadly designed to be for their intended use. 

Some test users found that the skis would extend far over their head and hit door frames as they walked through them. To alievate this we made it so the skies could rotate, lowering the height that they were at. This mostly soloved the issue with only really tall people still having an issue.
