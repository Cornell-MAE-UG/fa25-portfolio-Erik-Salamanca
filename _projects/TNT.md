Our goal was to design a dog leash that would have a progressive breaking system to redue tugging on the users from their dogs. To achieve this goal we used friction to slow down the flywheel with the leash. The harder the user pressed the more friction would be added slowing down the leash more. One concern we heard from test users was that if there was an emergancy and they need to stop their dog fast the slower brakeing would be a negative. To adress this we also added a emergency stop that would be switched like a leaver to place a hard stop on the fly wheel and stop it instantly. 

Our test users also told use that one thing they would like to be able to have on their walks was a tick remover. We decided that having one on the leash itself would be convient as now when you decide to go on a walk you can just grab one item. The tick remover is held in by its own expansion so it is easy to jsut slide in and out of its holder.
